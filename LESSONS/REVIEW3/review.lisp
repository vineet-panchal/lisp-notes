; HASH TABLES & KEY-VALUE PAIRS

; Arrays
; => data structure with a fixed size. Integer index values. Very restrictive. 

; Association-Lists or A-Lists
; => list of cons pairs. Dynamic structure. Rather than using index values, look at the car of each element.
; Ex: (defvar alist '((0 . "Zero")(1 . "One")(2 . "Two")(3 . "Three")))
; => these pairs refer to two values.
; => car would give the first element and cdr would give the second element.

; A-List: Search ==> O(n), not ordered so we need to check everything
; Ex: (assoc 3 *words*) ==> (3 . "Three")

; A-List: Add ==> O(1), don't care about the order
; Ex: (push '(4 . "Four") *words*) or cons to add to the rest of the list

; A-List: Remove
; Ex: (remove 3 *words* :key 'car)

; Hash Tables
; => hash tables maintain a database of keys and values.
; => hash tables have a fixed amount of memory allocated to maintaining its structure.
; => it has keys, values, and a backing array.
; => instead of indexing for elements, we use a hash function to tell us where the pair should go in our table.

; Ex:
; Position:            0            1            2            3            4            5   
;      Key:                                     78          133                        12
;    Value:                                    "A"          "X"                       "G"
;                                       (78 . "A")  (133 . "X")                (12 . "G")

; Hash Function
; => Given any key, the function returns an integer index that oyu could expect the key-value pair to be mapped to.

; Key - k
; Hash Function - h
; Index - h(k)

; Simplest Hash Function
; h(k) = k % (# of positions in the table)
; h(k) = k % N

; => hash tables have a fixed size, and every key is mapped to one specific place in the hash table.
; => however, multiple keys can (and will) map to that same position, causing collisions.

; Chaining
; => If more than one elements get mapped to the same index, then we chain them in a linked list
; => the problem with chaining is that it takes more overhead work to go through the elements of a linked list.

; Linear Probing
; => the process of resolving collisions where we keep checking the next place where a pair could exits in the table.

; Ex: Place (11 . "Eleven") (1 . "One") (4 . "Four") (5 . "Five") into a hash table with 7 positons using chaining and linear probing.
; (11 . "Eleven") ==> 11 % 7 = 4 => 3
; (1 . "One") ==> 1 % 7 = 1
; (4 . "Four") ==> 4 % 7 = 4
; (5 . "Five") ==> 5 % 7 = 5

;     Chaining                                         Linear Probing
; Index    Contents                                 Index       Contents
; 0                                                 0            
; 1        (1 . "One")                              1           (1 . "One")
; 2                                                 2 
; 3                                                 3
; 4        (11 . "Eleven") --> (4 . "Four")         4           (11 . "Eleven")
; 5        (5 . "Five")                             5           (4 . "Four")
; 6                                                 6           (5 . "Five")

; => in chaining, (11 . "Eleven") and (4 . "Four") are chained together in a linked list at position 4
;    because they both map to position 4 using the hash function

; => in linear probing, (11 . "Eleven") and (4 . "Four") are both mapped to position 4.
;    --> Since position 4 is already occupied by (11 . "Eleven"), (4 . "Four") is mapped to the next avaliable spot going down
;        in the hash table. In this case that would be position 5.
;    --> (5 . "Five") would map to position 5 using the hash function, however, position 5 is already occupied by (4 . "Four").
;        Therefore, it will be mapped to the next avaliable spot in the hash table which is position 6

; Linear Insertion/Adding Elements With Linear Probing
; => when adding new element, use hash function to find out where to put the new pair.
;    --> if unoccupied, insert it at the given position
;    --> if occupied, move to the next position and try there

; Linear Probing's Auxiliary Hash Function
; h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i) mod M, where i is the iteration/probe number

; Ex: Map 2, 10, and 18 in a hash table with 8 slots using the auxiliary hash function.
; h(2, 0) = (2 + 0) Mod 8 = 2    ==> 2 is mapped to position 2 on the hash table
; h(10, 0) = (10 + 0) Mod 8 = 2  x=> 10 cannot be mapped to position 2, as it is already taken 
; h(10, 1) = (10 + 1) Mod 8 = 3  ==> 10 is mapped to position 3 on the hash table
; h(18, 0) = (18 + 0) Mod 8 = 2  x=> 18 cannot be mapped to position 2, as it is already taken
; h(18, 1) = (18 + 1) Mod 8 = 3  x=> 18 cannot be mapped to position 3, as it is already taken
; h(18, 2) = (18 + 2) Mod 8 = 4  ==> 18 is mapped to position 4 on the hash table

; Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
;   Key:           2  10  18

; **Linear Probing is bound to clustering**

; Clustering
; => potential to build up a lot consecutive keys in the hash table
; => may lead to multiple iteration/probe attempts to find out if key exists.

; Ex: Consider the hash table below
; Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
;   Key:       a   b   c   d   e
; => if f was hashed to 1, we would need to search 6 positions before finding a position to map it to.

; => With linear probing, clustering builds up when more than one element is hashed to the same position.
; => the hash table becomes piled up in one section, while another section is empty
; => we want clustering to be more spread out throughout the hash table

; Quadratic Probing
; => same as linear, however the auxiliary hash function has i^2 to help distribute keys

; Quadratic Probing's Auxiliary Hash Function
; h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i + i^2) mod M, where i is the iteration/probe number

; Ex: Map 2, 10, and 18 in a hash table with 8 slots using the auxiliary hash function.
; h(2, 0) = (2 + 0 + 0) Mod 8 = 2    ==> 2 is mapped to position 2 on the hash table
; h(10, 0) = (10 + 0 + 0) Mod 8 = 2  x=> 10 cannot be mapped to position 2, as it is already taken
; h(10, 1) = (10 + 1 + 1) Mod 8 = 4  ==> 10 is mapped to position 4 on the hash table
; h(18, 0) = (18 + 0 + 0) Mod 8 = 2  x=> 18 cannot be mapped to position 2, as it is already taken
; h(18, 1) = (18 + 1 + 1) Mod 8 = 4  x=> 18 cannot be mapped to position 4, as it is already taken
; h(18, 2) = (18 + 2 + 4) Mod 8 = 0  ==> 18 is mapped to position 0 on the hash table

; Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
;   Key:  18       2      10

; => quadratic probing is not guaranteed to reduce collisions, but has a greater distribution with the goal of reducing collisions.

; Removing Elements In A Hash Table
; => we can't just remove an element from the hash table because other elements may rely on an element being there for linear probing.
; => instead of making the element NIL, we set it to DELETED.
;    --> this way wwe know that there used to be an element here, but not anymore
;    --> could overwrite it when adding a new element

; Implementing Hash Tables
; MAKE-HASH-TABLE ==> creates hash table
; GETHASH ==> look up item
; SETF and GETHASH ==> store an item
; REMHASH ==> remove a key
; INSPECT ==> inspect hash table
; MAPHASH ==> perform action on each key-value pair in the hash table





; TREES

; Basic Tree
; => trees are made of nodes
; => each node contains a value and a reference (list) to nodes below it
; => nodes cannot exist in multiple branches (branches do not overlap)
; => a node is considered a leaf if it has no nodes below it in the branch

; Example of a tree:
;            Head/Root Node
;            /            \
;         NodeA          NodeB
;        /     \        /     \
;     NodeA1  NodeA2  NodeB1 NodeB2
;    /      \
; NodeAX  NodeAY

(defstruct (tree-node (:conc-name nil))
  key ; the value of the node
  children) ; list of children nodes

; Searching General Tree, Tail-Recursive solution
(defun search-tree (e node &optional (found nil)) ; target, current node, return T/F
  (cond ((null node) found) ; if end of branch, return found
        (found e) ; if already found, return value
        ((listp node) (search-tree e (cdr node) (search-tree e (car node))))
        ((equal e (key node)) e)
        (t (search-tree e (children node)))))

; Searching General Tree, Iterative/Recursive solution
(defun search-treeIt (e node)
  (when node ; if node exists
    (if (equal e (key node)) e ; if found, return the value (True)
        (dolist (b (children node)) ; for each element in the children
          (let ((res (search-treeIt e b))) ; recursively call on each child
            (when res (return res))))))) ; if one of the children is the target, we found it

; General Tree Traversal

; Depth-First Search (DFS)
; => fully process a node and its children before moving back up to explore another branch

; Pre-Order: Current, All Children
; In-Order: Left, Current, Right (Only for BST)
; Post-Order: All Children, Current

; Ex: Consider the tree:
;       A
;    /  |  \ 
;   B   E   G
;  / \  |
; C   D F
; Pre-Order: ABCDEFG
; Post-Order: CDBFEGA

; Ex: Consider the binary tree:
;     A
;    / \
;   B   G
;  / \
; C   D
; In-Order: CBDAG

; Breadth-First Search (Level Order)
; => Visit every node on a level before going to the next level
; => need a system to be able to keep track of every node that should be included in the lower level

; Ex: Consider the tree:
;       A
;    /  |  \
;   B   E   G
;  / \  |
; C   D F
; BFS Level-Order: ABEGCDF





; Binary Search Trees
; => similar to a tree, except instead of having children, it has a left child and a right child
; => elements to the left are considered "less than" the current element, while elements to the right are "greater than" the current element

; Example of a binary tree:
;     35
;    /  \
;   10  37    ; 10 is less than 35 and 37 is greater than 35
;  /  \   \
; 8   11  99  ; 8 is less than 10, 11 is greater than 10, and 99 is greater than 37

(defstruct (bNode (:conc-name nil))
  key ; the value of the node
  (lc nil) ; left child node
  (rc nil)) ; right child node

; Why Use Binary Trees?
; => objects are sorted within the tree, rigid structure compared to a general tree with multiple children
; => O(logn) for search, insertion, modification, and deletion
; => Dynamic, we could use an array for binary search, but fixed size

; Insertion In Binary Trees
(defun bst-insert (obj bst comp)

            (left (lc bst)) ; let left be the left child node
            (right (rc bst))) ; let right be the right child node
        (cond ((funcall comp obj root) (setf (lc bst) (bst-insert obj left comp)))
              ; if obj compares with root, set the left child to be the recursive call of obj left binary tree and comp
              ((funcall comp root obj) (setf (rc bst) (bst-insert obj right comp)))
              ; if root compares with obj, set the right child to be the recursive call of obj right binary tree and comp
              (t bst)) ; else return the binary tree
        bst))) ; return binary tree

; (defvar myTree nil)
; (setf myTree (bst-insert myTree 5 #'<))
; (setf myTree (bst-insert myTree 1 #'<))
; (setf myTree (bst-insert myTree 3 #'<))
;    5
;   / \
;  1
; / \
;    3

; Finding Elements In Binary Trees
(defun bst-find (val node)
  (cond ((null node) nil) ; if the binary tree is null, return nil
        ((eq val (key node)) node) ; if val and the key of the node is equal, return the tree
        ((< val (key node)) (bst-find val (lc node))) ; if val is less than the key, recursively call the val and the left child
        (t (bst-find val (rc node))))) ; else if val is greater than the key, recursively call the val and the right child

; Removing Elements In Binary Trees
; => removal involves rearranging the tree

; Splay Trees
; => just like a binary tree, but every time we search for a node, that node "splays" to the top of the tree through a series or rotations
; => the tree must always be in sorted order

; Ex: Let's search for 11 in the following tree
;     35                     35               _11_
;    /  \                   /  \              /  \ 
;   10   37       ==>    _11_   37    ==>   10   35
;  /  \   \              /       \         /       \
; 8  _11_  99           10        99      8        37

; Inserting Into A Splay Tree
; => to insert a node, descent the tree (less-left, greater-right) until we find the existing node or we find the place to insert.
; => after inserting splay the node up the tree to bring it to the top





; Heaps
; => they are binary trees, but they are not sorted like a binary tree
; => instead decreasing (or increasing) values as you descent the tree
; => for each node x with parent p, x's value should be less (or greater) than p's

; Min-Heap
; => all of the smaller values are at the top (the parent nodes are smaller than their children nodes) 

; Example of a min-heap
;      3
;    /   \
;   7    25
;  / \   /
; 22 18 29

; Max-Heap
; => all of the greater values are at the top (all the parent nodes are greater than their children nodes) 

; Example of a max-heap:
;       80
;     /    \ 
;   50      70
;  /  \    /  \
; 25  45  12  65

; Array Representation
; => first is parent, then left child, and finally right child.
; => the array is repeated for each branch

; Ex: Consider the following tree. The array representation for the tree is: 
;      3
;    /   \     Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6

; Graphs
; => a graph G is defined as G = (V, E), where:
;    --> V is a set of vertices
;    --> E is a set of edges, each connecting a pair of vertices
;        --> edges may be directed or undirected
;        --> if all edges are directed, we have a directed graph

; Path
; => a sequence of vertices connected by edges

; Cycle
; => a path in a directed graph that starts and ends at the same vertex
; => a graph with no cycles is an acyclic graph
; => a directed graph with no cycles is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

; Graph Representation: List ==> (Vi Vf Weight)
; => a list where each element is a list with (Vi Vf Weight)

; Graph Representation: Adjacency List ==> (Vi ((Vf Weight) ...))
; => a list where each element is a list with a vertex (Vi) and a list of key values (Vf - key, W - value)

; Graph Representation: Adjacency Matrix
; => N by N matrix where n is the number of vertices, and each cell corresponds to the cost/weight of the edge between two vertices.
; => rows represent Vi and columns represent Vf

; Ex: Consider the graph:
; V0 --(5)--> V1 --(4)--> V2 --(9)--> V3 --(7)--> V4   ,   V0 --(2)--> V5 --(8)--> V4   ,   V3 --(3)--> V5 --(1) --> V2
; the representation for this graph as a list is:
; setf *G* '(
;    (V0 V1 5)
;    (V0 V5 2)
;    (V1 V2 4)
;    (V2 V3 9)
;    (V3 V4 7)
;    (V3 V5 3)
;    (V5 V2 1)
;    (V5 V4 8)
; )
; the representation of this graph as an adjacency list is:
; setf *G* '(
;    (V0 ((V1 . 5) (V5 . 2)))
;    (V1 ((V2 . 4)))
;    (V2 ((V3 . 9)))
;    (V3 ((V4 . 7) (V5 . 3)))
;    (V5 ((V2 . 1) (V4 . 8)))
; )
; the representation of this graph as an adjacency matrix is:
;      V0   V1   V2   V3   V4   V5
; V0         5                   2
; V1              4
; V2                   9
; V3                        7    3
; V4     
; V5              1         8

; Spanning Tree
; => For a graph G = (V, E), a spanning tree is an acyclic subset of E that connects all the vertices in V using |V| - 1 edges.

; Minimum Spanning Tree
; => For a graph G = (V, E), the MST is a spanning tree where the sums of the weights of the edges is the minimum possible sum.
; => its the subtree that connects all nodes where the sum is the minimum of the weights combined

; Example for the previous graph, the MST is:
; V0 --(2)--> V5 --(3)--> V3 --(7)--> V4   ,   V1 --(4)--> V2 --(1)--> V5

; Prim's Algorithm => A method to obtain the MST of a given graph
; 1. Initialize Variables
;    ==> mstSet: a set of vertices in the SPT
;    ==> pq: a priority queue containing the vertices not yet in mstSet
; 2. For each vertex V in G
;    ==> insert in pq a pair (V weight) setting weight to be initially infinite
; 3. If V is S, assign 0 as the weight
; 4. Sort pq based on weight of each pair (V Weight)
